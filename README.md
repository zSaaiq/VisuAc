# VisuAc

VisuAc is a SiriWave-like music visualizer built with SwiftUI. Currently, it supports importing your own music, but it is not yet saved to the app. The visualizer is a work in progress, and sometimes it does not respond accurately to the music being played.

## Issues

- **High CPU Usage & Battery Drain**: The app experiences significant CPU usage, which leads to a fast battery drain.
  
- **Audio Import Limitation**: Audio can only be imported while in the Import View. If you navigate away from this view, the audio needs to be imported again.
  
- **Visualizer Accuracy**: The music visualizer does not always react accurately to the music being played. Sometimes.

## Screenshots

1. **Home Screen**: The main screen where you can interact with the app, navigate to different sections, and start the audio visualizer.
  
2. **Music Import**: The screen where you can import your own music. Currently, audio needs to be re-imported every time you exit the Import View.
  
3. **Visualizer**: The screen that displays the music visualizer in action. However, as mentioned, the visualizer's response to music can sometimes be imperfect.
